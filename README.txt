# JHU - Week 2 - Assignment

## Name: 
Irina Nobaeva, Student ID 'INOBAEV1'

## Module Info: 
The Module 2: Compound Interest is due on Sunday, February 7, 2021 at 11:59 EST.

## Approach: 
For this assignment were used PyCharm and VS Code applications, downloaded from Blackboard and installed inside Oracle's VirtualBox. 
All commands for assignment were written using Python Programming Language (string input/output, data types, operators, and expressions). 
Submitted files interest.py and rate.py can be open in any IDE that support Python program.

## Programming Assignment:

Part 1. For the first assignment was written a program named interest.py to compute the total payment over the life of a loan as well as the amount of interest paid. For computation were given the formula and following values: 
The total principal amount (P, an integer) = 625937
The interest rate (r, a float) = 0.035
The term of the loan in years (t, an integer) = 30
The number of interest payments per year (n, an integer) = 12

Part 2. For the second assignment it was written a program named rate.py to calculate the interest rate, using the values from the first assignment such as P, t, n, and the Total Amount of money that will be paid over the full term of the loan received as a result from interest.py.
Performing some algebraic manipulations on the formula it was formed a solution that specifies r in terms of Total Amount, P, n and t.
The result of the computation in Part 2 is 0.03500000000000014 what is very close to r = 0.035 from Part 1. The difference of 0.00000000000000014 can be the reason of using mathematical complex functions such as dividing and exponentiation. Also r is a float number and floating-point numbers in Python can have a maximum value that is system-dependent.
