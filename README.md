Module Info: The Module 1 Hello, world! is due on 01/31/2021 at 11:59 EST.

Approach: 

For this assignment were used following IDE's: PyCharm and VS Code, downloaded from Blackboard and installed inside Oracle's VirtualBox. All commands for assignment were written using Python Programming Language. 

a detailed description of the approach you implemented to solving the assignment. Be
as specific as possible. If you are sorting a list of 2D points in a plane, describe the class you used
to represent a point, the data structures you used to store them, and the algorithm you used to
sort them, for example. The more descriptive you are, the more credit we can award in the event
your solution doesn’t fully work.

Known Bugs: describe the areas, if any, where your code has any known bugs. If you’re asked to
write a function to do a computation but you know your function returns an incorrect result, this
should be noted here. Please also state how you would go about fixing the bug. If your code
produces results correctly you do not have to include this section.
